  Wikipedia[c] is a free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers,
   known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Founded by
    Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia
     Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[1] Wikipedi
     a is the largest and most-read reference work in history.[2][3]

Initially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is one of 
the world's most visited websites. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, rema
ins the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 66 million articles and attract
 more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about five edits per second o
 n average) as of April 2024.[W 1] As of December 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the Unite
 d States, while Japan accounts for nearly 7%, and the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia each represent around 5%.[4]

Wikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge, its extensi
ve coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments,
 ranging from specific pages to the entire site, sometimes due to its criticism of the government or by
  content otherwise considered blasphemous.[5][6] Although Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written ext
  ensively on a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has also been criticized for systemic bias, such as a
   gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the Global South.[7][8] While the reliability of
    Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from 
    the late 2010s onward.[2][9][10] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information
     about those events.[11][12]
